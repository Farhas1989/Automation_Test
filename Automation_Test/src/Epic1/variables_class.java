    * double - stores fractional numbers from 1.7eâˆ’308 to 1.7e+308. Note that you should end the value with a "d"
    * float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 (float myFloatNum = 5.99f;)
    * char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes (char myLetter = 'D';)
